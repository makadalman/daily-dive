# A daily skydive
Every competitive skydiver needs a training regime, something to guide visualization.
Every day, a new skydive. Built just like a competition draw, it takes the whole dive pool, and depletes it every day, until all formations and blocks have been used. Then it starts over again. The combinations are endless.

## Currently UPSA 4way Open class
The plan is to evolve to encompass more divisions and disciplines.

### The plan
* Host the application
* Schedule the creation of the dive
* Tidy up the Dive Card visualization
* Possibly build the diagrams natively
* Is there an email service? or a way to text myself?
* Expand to 4way Intermediate and Rookie
* Expand to 8way Open and Intermediate

## Built in React with Mui and Firestore
React v19
Firetore v11.5
MUI v6.4.8
